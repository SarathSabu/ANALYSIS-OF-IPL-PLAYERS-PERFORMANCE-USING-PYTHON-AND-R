The Indian Premier League (IPL) is one of the most prominent and lucrative professional T20 cricket leagues globally, featuring elite players from around the world. The performance of players in the IPL is not only crucial for the success of their respective teams but also significantly impacts their market value and salary negotiations. 
This project aims to analyze the relationship between a playerâ€™s on-field performance, specifically the runs scored by batsmen, and their salaries. Understanding this relationship can provide insights into how player performance influences their market value and can aid teams in making informed decisions during player auctions and contract renewals.
